  (The files in the clib/ subdirectory bear a BSD-4 license header, yet the
  only copyright holder of those files is the University of California,
  Berkeley, which removed the ad-clause in 1997 retroactively (i.e. it
  relicensed all BSD-4 code under its copyright to BSD-3). Thus those files
  are effectively distributed under the BSD-3 license as well.)
