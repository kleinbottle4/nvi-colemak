Notes
-----

* Debian tracks the development branch of nvi (1.81.6) since the release
  of Etch. This branch has support for multibyte character sets (i.e.
  UTF-8). The nvi package is built with UTF support, however the feature
  is quite young and nvi goes to great lengths to preserve historic
  behaviour in many respects, so if there are problems with nvi's charset
  handling, please report them in the bugtracker.
