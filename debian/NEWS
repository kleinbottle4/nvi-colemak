nvi (1.81.6-12) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The nviboot init script has had functionality moved outside of init
    and the remainder renamed to nvi.  If you made changes you likely
    should look at modifying the recover script instead of what's in init.
  * A systemd unit for nvi was also added that takes precedence if running
    on a system with systemd.
